The puropse of this project move a company's code into GitHub.

What I learned:
Make changes to that project and make it available to the community. Fork a GitHub repository, clone
that repository to the local system, make changes to the local repository, commit the changes locally, push it back to your GitHub fork,
and create a pull request to add an update to the original repository.
